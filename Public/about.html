    Hey there, I'm Rayan! A 2021 graduate of a BBA at HEC Montréal. After taking my first UX class I completely fell in love with the field. I have since completed the Google certification on UX design, worked with Tech3lab as a research assistant, joined Lemieux Bédard as a designer and even co-founded Alibi, a company that aims to revolutionize the world of nightlife. To learn more about these different experiences, take a look at my case studies!

    When I'm not working you can find me watching basketball, working out, dreaming about my next travel adventure or creating yet another Spotify playlist.
